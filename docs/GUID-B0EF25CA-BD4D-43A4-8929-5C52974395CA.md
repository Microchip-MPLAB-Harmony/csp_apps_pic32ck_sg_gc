# TCC Compare Mode

This example shows how to use the TCC module in compare mode to generate different<br /> waveforms.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

Three TCC channels are configured in compare mode. Each channel generates different<br /> output waveform depending upon configured action on compare match and period<br /> match.

**Normal Frequency Mode**: The waveform generation output \(WO\[x\]\) is toggled on<br /> each compare match between COUNT and CCx

**Match Frequency Mode**: The waveform generation output \(WO\[0\]\) is toggled on<br /> each time COUNT register is auto updated.
