# ADC Interrupt

This example application shows how to use the ADC Peripheral library in interrupt mode to<br /> convert multiple analog inputs.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

The example configures ADC0 channel 0 and channel 1 in scan mode. The scan trigger<br /> source is configured as ADC trigger event. RTC is configured to generate a periodic<br /> RTC compare match event. ADC trigger is configured as the user of the RTC compare<br /> match event. ADC starts conversion of channel 0 and channel 1 on every scan trigger<br /> and generates a end of scan interrupt when conversion for both the channels is<br /> complete.

ADC0 channel 2 is configured to start conversion on global software trigger and is<br /> initiated by user pressing a switch on the development board. The application prints<br /> the ADC count and the corresponding analog voltage on the serial terminal.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
-   ADC Core 0 Channel 0 input is available on PA04 \(Pin 3 of EXT1\). Connect PA04 to analog input voltage
-   ADC Core 0 Channel 1 input is available on PA05 \(Pin 4 of EXT1\). Connect PA05 to analog input voltage
-   ADC Core 0 Channel 2 input is available on PA06 \(Pin 3 of EXT2\). Connect PA06 to analog input voltage

## Running the Application

1.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
2.  Connect to the PKOB4 Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
3.  The demo application will print the ADC count and the corresponding analog voltage measured on pin PA04 \(ADC0\_AIN0, Pin 3 of EXT1\) and pin PA05 \(ADC0\_AIN1, Pin 4 of EXT1\):
