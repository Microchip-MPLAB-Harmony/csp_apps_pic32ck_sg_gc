# DMAC Memory Transfer

This example application demonstrates how to use the DMAC peripheral to do a memory to<br /> memory transfer.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

The application uses a software trigger to initiate a memory-memory transfer from the<br /> source buffer to the destination buffer. After the transfer is complete the<br /> application verifies the data and prints the status on the serial console.
