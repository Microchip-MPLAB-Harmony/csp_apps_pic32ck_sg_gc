# WDT Timeout

This example shows how to generate a Watchdog timer reset by emulating a deadlock.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

This example application shows how the WDT peripheral library resets the watchdog<br /> timer by not feeding the watchdog on switch press. The application sets up the<br /> watchdog to reset the device. The application also sets up the timer to blink an LED<br /> to emulate a process. A user switch press forces the device to wait in an infinite<br /> loop to emulate a deadlock. As a result a device reset is triggered as the watchdog<br /> counter overflows the bounded value.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer
2.  Connect to the PKOB4 Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
3.  Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4.  LED should be blinking and the console displays the following message

    ![](GUID-293A5F1B-9500-4417-AC79-049D7C1F3A82-low.png)

5.  Press the switch to put the system in a deadlock
6.  LED should stop blinking and the console should print the following message

    ![](GUID-B3086B98-957A-4C86-B3F0-9F3467B21FD5-low.png)

7.  WDT will reset the device in four seconds and the demonstration should restart
