This example application demonstrate how to poll the switch input, and indicate the<br /> switch status using the LED.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

This application uses the PORT Peripheral library to read the GPIO pin connected to<br /> the switch, and drives the GPIO pin connected to the LED to indicate the switch<br /> status. LED is turned ON when the switch is pressed and turned OFF when the switch<br /> is released.
