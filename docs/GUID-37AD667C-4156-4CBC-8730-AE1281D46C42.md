# AC Sleepwalking

This example application shows how to use the AC Peripheral library to perform a single<br /> shot comparison in standby sleep mode periodically and wake up the device when the<br /> comparator output toggles.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

The negative input of analog comparator is connected to internal Bandgap voltage and<br /> the positive input is connected to internal DAC. The DAC output voltage is varied by<br /> the user. User presses ‘U’/’u’ to increment and ‘D’/’d’ to decrement the DAC output<br /> voltage. Single shot conversion is triggered by RTC compare event. Generation of a<br /> trigger and compare operation are done while the CPU is in the standby sleep mode.<br /> AC generates the interrupt when the comparator output toggles, which wakes the<br /> CPU.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
2.  Connect to the PKOB4 Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
3.  Following message is displayed on the console:
