# CAN FD Interrupt

This example application shows how to use the CAN module to transmit and receive CAN FD<br /> messages in interrupt mode.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

This application transmits CAN FD message to CAN Bus and receives CAN FD message from<br /> CAN Bus. To run this application, two evaluation boards of same type are required.<br /> These boards acts as different nodes on the CAN bus. Same application is programmed<br /> onto both the boards. Boards are connected to PC via UART. While running the<br /> application, user can send and receive CAN FD messages between the boards using UART<br /> console applications running on the PC.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect PIC32CK-GC01 Curiosity Ultra board to another PIC32CK-GC01 Curiosity Ultra board as per the pin connections shown below

    |PIC32CK-GC01<br /> Curiosity Ultra board - 1|PIC32CK-GC01<br /> Curiosity Ultra board - 2|
    |----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
    |CANH, CAN0|CANH, CAN0|
    |CANL, CAN0|CANL, CAN0|
    |GND, CAN0|GND, CAN0|

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer
2.  Connect to the PKOB4 Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
3.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
4.  In the console associated with board 1, press â€œ0â€? to transmit a CAN FD message
5.  Transmitted message description and status will be displayed in the console window of board 1
6.  Received message will be displayed in the console window of board 2
7.  Follow the sequence below to send and receive different messages:
    -   Press â€˜1â€™ on board 1
    -   Press â€˜2â€™ on board 1
    -   Press â€˜3â€™ on board 1
    -   Press â€˜4â€™ on board 1
    -   Press â€˜0â€™ on board 2
    -   Press â€˜1â€™ on board 2
    -   Press â€˜2â€™ on board 2
    -   Press â€˜3â€™ on board 2
    -   Press â€˜4â€™ on board 2
8.  If the steps are executed in this sequence, the final output in the consoles will be as below \(console on the left is the transmitter \(board 1\) and the one on the right is receiver \(board 2\)\):
