# SQI Flash Read Write

This example application demonstrates how to use the SQI Peripheral library to perform<br /> erase, write and read operation with the on-board SST26 SQI Serial Flash memory.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

This example uses the SQI peripheral library to erase and write an array of values to<br /> the on-board SST26 SQI Serial Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading<br /> the values back and comparing it to the value written.
