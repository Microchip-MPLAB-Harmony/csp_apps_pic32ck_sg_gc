# ADC Blocking

This example application shows how to use the ADC Peripheral library in blocking mode to<br /> convert analog input on a ADC channel.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

The example application uses Global Software trigger to start a conversion on a ADC<br /> channel input and blocks until the conversion is complete. Once the ADC conversion<br /> is complete, it reads the ADC count value, converts it into analog voltage and<br /> prints it on the serial terminal.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
-   ADC Core 0 Channel 0 input is available on PA04 \(Pin 3 of EXT1\). Connect PA04 to analog input voltage.

## Running the Application

1.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
2.  Connect to the PKOB4 Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
3.  The demo application will print the ADC count and the corresponding analog<br /> voltage measured on pin PA04 \(Pin 3 of EXT1\):
