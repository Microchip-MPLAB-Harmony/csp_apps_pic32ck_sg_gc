# SERCOM USART Ring Buffer

This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM peripheral in USART ring<br /> buffer mode to transfer data in a non-blocking manner.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

This example demonstrates read and write over USART using the ring buffer mode. The<br /> USART is configured in non-blocking mode \(interrupts enabled\). The example asks the<br /> user to enter 10 characters. Once received, the characters are echoed back. In the<br /> process, the example demonstrates various ring buffer APIs.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer
2.  Connect to the PKOB4 Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
3.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
4.  The console displays the following message

    -   Console displays the initial transmit and receive buffer sizes
    -   It then adds 10 characters - â€œ0123456789â€? to the transmit buffer and displays the available free space in the transmit buffer after the 10 characters have been added
    -   The message asks the user to enter 10 characters
    -   *NOTE: For this example, the â€œFree Space in Transmit Buffer = xxâ€?, where xx can be anything between 117 to 127, depending on the USART baud rate and the CPU execution speed*
5.  Enter 10 characters on the terminal
6.  Entered characters are echoed back on the console and message is displayed indicating that the receive notification is turned on
