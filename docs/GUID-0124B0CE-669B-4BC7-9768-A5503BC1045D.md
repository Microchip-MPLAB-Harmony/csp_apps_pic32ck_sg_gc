# SERCOM SPI Interrupt

This example application shows how to use SERCOM SPI PLIB with external loop back to<br /> write and then read back an array of data in interrupt mode.

## Description

This example shows the transmit and receive operation over a SPI interface in a<br /> non-blocking manner. The peripheral interrupt is used to manage the transfer. It<br /> transmits an array of values and verifies the value transmitted by receiving the<br /> values back with look back and comparing it to the value transmitted. The loop back<br /> test requires the MOSI output pin to be connected to the MISO input pin so that<br /> anything transmitted will also be received.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Use a jumper wire to short pin 05 and pin 06 of the MikroBUS header
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build and Program the application project using its IDE
2.  LED indicates the success or failure:
    -   The LED is turned ON when the received value matches with the transmitted value
    -   The LED is turned OFF when the received value does not match with the transmitted value
3.  SPI data transfer and compare match checking happens only one time

The following table shows the LED name:
