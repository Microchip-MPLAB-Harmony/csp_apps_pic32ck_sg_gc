# Clock Configuration

This example application shows how to configure the clock system to run the device at<br /> maximum frequency. It also outputs a prescaled clock signal on a GPIO pin for<br /> measurement and verification.

## Description

Clock system generates and distributes the clock for the processor and peripherals.<br /> This example application shows how to use the clock manager to configure the device<br /> to run at the max possible speed. A prescaled clock signal is routed to GPIO pin to<br /> measure the frequency and accuracy of the internal device clock.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect an oscilloscope to monitor the PORT pin PC01 \(Pin 07 of the EXT1 header\)
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
2.  Observe a clock of ~3 MHz on the clock output pin
3.  LED should be blinking continuously

Refer to the following table for clock output pin and LED name for different<br /> boards:

|Board|Clock Output Pin|LED Name|
