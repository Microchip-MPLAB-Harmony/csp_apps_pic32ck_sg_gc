# SERCOM USART Interrupt

This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM peripheral in USART mode to<br /> transfer data in a non-blocking manner.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

This example shows the read and write operation over a UART in a non-blocking manner.<br /> The peripheral interrupt is used to manage the transfer. It receives 10 characters<br /> from the terminal window and echoes them back.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.: Tera term\) on the computer
2.  Connect to the PKOB Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
3.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
4.  The console displays the following message

    ![](GUID-7CA081F5-B7A7-44A4-8E8B-C8171C1DBC4E-low.png)

5.  Type 10 characters in the console
6.  Entered characters will be echoed back and the LED is toggled
7.  The following table provides the LED names
