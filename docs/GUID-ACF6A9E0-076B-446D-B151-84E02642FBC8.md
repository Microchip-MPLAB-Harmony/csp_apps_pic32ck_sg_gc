# SERCOM I2C EEPROM Read Write

This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM peripheral to write and read<br /> from the I2C serial EEPROM memory.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

This example uses the I2C peripheral library to write an array of values to the I2C<br /> Serial EEPROM and verify the value written by reading the values back and comparing<br /> it to the value written.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
2.  LED indicates success or failure:
    -   The LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matches with the written value
    -   The LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

The following table shows the LED name:
