# DSU CRC32 Generate

This example application demonstrates how to use the DSU Peripheral library to compute<br /> 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Checksum \(CRC\).

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

The DSU unit provides support for calculating a 32-bit CRC value for a memory area.<br /> This example application computes the 32-bit hardware CRC value using the DSU<br /> Peripheral and validates it using a software-calculated CRC value.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
2.  The LED indicates the success or failure:
    -   LED is turned ON when the hardware CRC value matched with the software calculated CRC value
    -   LED is turned OFF when the hardware CRC value did not match with the software calculated CRC value

The following table provides the LED name
