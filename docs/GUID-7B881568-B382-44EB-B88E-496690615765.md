# CAN Blocking

This example application shows how to use the CAN module to transmit and receive normal<br /> CAN messages in polling mode.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

This application transmits CAN message to CAN Bus and receives CAN message from CAN<br /> Bus. To run this application, two evaluation boards of same type are required. These<br /> boards acts as different nodes on the CAN bus. Same application is programmed onto<br /> both the boards. Boards are connected to PC via UART. While running the application,<br /> user can send and receive CAN messages between the boards using UART console<br /> applications running on the PC.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect PIC32CK-GC01 Curiosity Ultra board to another PIC32CK-GC01 Curiosity Ultra board as per the pin connections shown below

|PIC32CK-GC01 Curiosity Ultra<br /> board - 1|PIC32CK-GC01 Curiosity Ultra<br /> board - 2|
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|CANH, CAN0|CANH, CAN0|
|CANL, CAN0|CANL, CAN0|
|GND, CAN0|GND, CAN0|

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.: Tera term\) on the computer
2.  Connect to the PKOB4 Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
3.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
4.  In the console associated with board 1, press â€œ1â€? to transmit a CAN message
5.  Transmitted message status will be displayed in the console window of board 1
6.  Received message will be displayed in the console window of board 2
7.  Follow the sequence below to send and receive CAN message:
    -   Press â€˜1â€™ on board 2
8.  If the steps are executed in this sequence, the final output in the consoles will be as below \(console on the left is the transmitter \(board 1\) and the one on the right is receiver \(board 2\)\):
