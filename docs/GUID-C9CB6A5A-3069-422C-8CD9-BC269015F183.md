# PM Wakeup Using EIC

This application demonstrates entering the low power modes and exiting it using the<br /> EIC.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for PIC32CK-GC/SG Family](GUID-5EB5829A-8D62-4A5E-B89B-DF7EF4E334A2.md)

## Description

The PM peripheral library is used to enter the low power mode and the device exits<br /> low power mode when the button is pressed. To identify a button push, the EIC is<br /> configured to detect a falling edge on the GPIO pin connected to the switch.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Board

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
-   Connect VCC and GND between EXT2 and Mikrobus Xplained board

## Running the Application

1.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer
2.  Connect to the PKOB4 Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
3.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
4.  LED is blinked continuously using the SysTick Timer
5.  The console displays the following message
