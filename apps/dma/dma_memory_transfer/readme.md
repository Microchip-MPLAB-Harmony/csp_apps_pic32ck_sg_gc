# DMAC memory transfer

This example application demonstrates how to use the DMAC peripheral to do a memory to memory transfer.

## Description

The application uses a software trigger to initiate a memory-memory transfer from the source buffer to the destination buffer. After the transfer is complete the application verifies the data and prints the status on the serial console.
