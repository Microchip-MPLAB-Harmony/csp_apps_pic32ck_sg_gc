# SERCOM USART interrupt

This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM peripheral in USART mode to transfer data in a non-blocking manner.

## Description

This example shows the read and write operation over a UART in a non-blocking manner. The peripheral interrupt is used to manage the transfer. It receives 10 characters from the terminal window and echoes them back.

### Setting up [PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra board]()

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the PKOB Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. The console displays the following message
