# SQI flash read write

This example application demonstrates how to use the SQI Peripheral library to perform erase, write and read operation with the on-board SST26 SQI Serial Flash memory.

## Description

This example uses the SQI peripheral library to erase and write an array of values to the on-board SST26 SQI Serial Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.
